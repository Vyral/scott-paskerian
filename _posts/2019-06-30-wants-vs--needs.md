If you don’t want to spin your wheels while looking for the perfect home, then you need to nail down exactly what kind of property you’re looking for. **To do so, the first step you must take is to identify your wants and needs. And, yes: There is a difference.&nbsp;**

Knowing the difference between your wants and your needs will keep you grounded in reality, allowing you to limit your search to properties that fit your day-to-day lifestyle, rather than properties that might fulfill some of your less-than-practical wishes. Don’t get me wrong: It’s great to dream big. However, overextending your budget for a home that doesn’t suit your needs right now is never a good move.

Think of it this way: You might want a home that has a walk-out balcony or a backyard swimming pool, but you shouldn’t put these desires over the things you actually need. So, before you begin your home search, **write down a list of all the qualities your future home needs to have and another list of all the qualities you would like for it to have.** This will help guide you toward the best possible fit.&nbsp;
