You probably hear updates on our market all the time, and sometimes this massive influx of information can be more confusing than enlightening.

&nbsp;With all the different messages out there about what’s going on in our real estate market, what should buyers and sellers be taking away? After all, the main question on your mind is probably one that these messages don’t answer directly: **When is the best time to buy and sell?**

First, as you begin thinking of your time frame for making a move, don’t rely on national numbers. Nationwide statistics won’t reflect what’s happening locally, as every market is different. Even markets within the same city can vary greatly.

Second, you should look at mortgage rates—but make sure you take the proper approach. Mortgage rates fluctuate more frequently than you might assume, going up and down each day. If you want a good, general idea of where rates are, it’s usually best to look at the 10-year Treasury note. As a rule, though, rates are fantastic right now. It’s a great time for buyers to make a move.

With all of this in mind, **the most important factor in your decision to make a move has nothing to do with numbers—it’s all about what’s best for you and your family.** The best time to make a move is whenever it makes the most sense for you to do so.
