Here are three reasons why it may be time for you to sell and upgrade to a new home:&nbsp;

**1\. Money.** Has your salary increased, or have you finally received that long-awaited bonus? Or perhaps you got married and now have a dual income? The market is only going to go up, so it’s better to use that money to buy now than wait a year or two.

**2\. You feel cramped.** If you’re tired of walking over everyone to get from point A to point B or your storage space is running out, it’s time to buy a house with more space, especially if you’re thinking about expanding your family.&nbsp;

**3\. It’s time to downsize.** If your kids are grown up, you have no reason to stick around your suburban area for school reasons, and you’d like to enjoy your golden years in a vibrant city setting, it’s time to sell. Who knows—maybe they’ll have more fun visiting you in your new downtown home\!
