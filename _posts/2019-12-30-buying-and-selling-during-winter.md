*Despite what you may think, winter is a great time to buy or sell a home. Here’s why.*

There are several obvious reasons buyers or sellers wouldn’t want to make their move during winter, but here are a few reasons why this season is actually a great time to buy or sell:

**Sellers:**

**1\. There is less competition.** Statistics show that there are fewer homes on the market right now, but that just means buyers will have a better chance at actually seeing your home. This heightened attention increases the odds you’ll get a better return on your sale.&nbsp;

**2\. Buyers have more urgency.** Buyers who are out and about searching for homes during the winter usually have good reason for doing so. Usually, it’s either because they couldn’t find a home in the spring, summer, or fall markets, or they’re going through a job relocation and need to buy in their new home city before making their move.&nbsp;

**Buyers:**

**1\. Home shopping now means seeing a home in its entirety.** If you’re buying a home, you want to know that its systems and appliances are working well and you’ll be able to get through your first winter without needing to make any major repairs, and buying during winter allows this.

**2\. Your agent has more time to focus on you.** As I said, there are fewer homes on the market right now, which means your agent probably has fewer clients at this time of year and they can devote more energy to getting you the best deal.&nbsp;
