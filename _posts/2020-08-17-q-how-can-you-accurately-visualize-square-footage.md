Have you ever thought a home was going to be massive, but when you walked in it turned out to feel somewhat small? Visualizing square footage is difficult because envisioning something and seeing it in person can be very different experiences. **Photos can be distorted** when you look at a house online, and even 3D tours can have “bubbles” that alter the perceived room size.

First of all, a square foot is 12 inches by 12 inches, so if you laid that square over and over on the floor of a room, that’s how much square footage it has. Next, you can consider some common reference points. For example, a king-size bed is 42 square feet, which can help you figure out the size of a bedroom. A two-car garage is generally 400 square feet, and a tennis court is 2,800 square feet. In the city, you aren’t likely to find a floor that’s as big as a tennis court, so **if you can break a tennis court in half in your mind, that will give you an idea of how large the average story of a house is.&nbsp;**

Layouts can look completely different in pictures versus in person. 1,000 square feet in one property can feel very different in another.&nbsp;

Take into consideration whether the home is furnished or unfurnished; this makes a huge difference in how you can reference things in your mind. Remember that a space with more items in it will feel smaller. Sometimes you may think your sofa will look gigantic in a space, when in reality it’ll look just fine. Also, **think about angles;** does the room have them, or is it more of a standard square or rectangle?&nbsp;

Visualizing a house is often very dissimilar to seeing it in person, so you should always visit properties personally whenever possible.&nbsp;
