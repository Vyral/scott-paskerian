If you’re searching for homes, that typically means you’re finished with your mortgage pre-approval and you’ve made a list of your wants and needs for the home you want to buy. Now is the time to research which neighborhood you want to live in. Today I’ll discuss how to ensure that you’re making the best choice when it comes to selecting an area to purchase a home in.

Mind you, **your choice of neighborhood will be dependent on your budget.** Once you’ve located areas you like that are also within your price range, it’s important to spend some time in the neighborhoods you’re considering.

To help you make your ultimate decision, **do a test-drive through the neighborhood.** Check out the local businesses, walk around the area, or maybe even stay for the weekend to get the full experience of the area at all times of the day. Once you’ve spent enough time to get the general feel and layout, consider whether or not this is a place you would want to live in for, say, the next five, 10, or even 20 years.

Additionally, **you’ll want to figure out your commute to work.** How long will it take you to drive? Is public transportation available? What will traffic be like to and from your workplace? Knowing these things can be a big deciding factor in whether or not a neighborhood is right for you. I’ve had clients in the past who fell in love with a property in a neighborhood they like, but once they found out that their commute would be long or complex, they ultimately decided to pass on it. **This is why it’s important to hone your neighborhood choices at the beginning of the process;** that way, you can decide what you’re willing to deal with in terms of your commute.

So if you’re ready to figure out what neighborhood you’d like to end up in, reach out to me. We can figure it out together—check out a few hotspots, grab a couple drinks, and just get the general feel of an area.<br>&nbsp;
