Do you want to avoid the anger, frustration, and annoyance of not being prepared when you go out searching for your first home? **Here’s what you need to do first in order to get ready to search for your first your home.**

Real estate is always in the news. Inventory is at an all-time low, and finding the right home is difficult. Although it can be challenging, there are ways for you to be prepared for when you’re ready to start that search.

**I always recommend that buyers get pre-approved before they go out looking for homes.** Personally, I don’t even want to show homes to buyers until they have been pre-approved because they don’t know what they can afford otherwise. They might think they do, but nothing is set in stone until that pre-approval is issued. It makes the entire process much easier and much simpler.

If you’re ready to start your home search today, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to provide you with a list of local lenders that I trust and answer any other questions you may have. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
