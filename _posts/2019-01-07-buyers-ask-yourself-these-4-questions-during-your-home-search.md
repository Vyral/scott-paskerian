When it comes time to begin your home search, there are certain questions all buyers should keep in mind as they review their options. We’ll be sharing four such questions today: 

**1. How is the neighborhood?** Narrowing down the area you want to live in is especially important in our Boston market, as amenities and lifestyle will vary by neighborhood. <br><br>**2. How is the commute?** Before you settle on a certain home, don’t forget to consider the time you’ll spend driving to and from it for work, to see family, or to take your children to school.

**3. What are the condo fees?** If you’re choosing to live in a condo, you’ll need to be aware of this expense and what it includes. These fees will vary by location, as well as by the number of units within a given building. 

**4. How old are the home’s big-ticket items?** If a listing’s major systems and appliances are nearing (or even past) their life expectancy, you could find yourself shelling out additional money shortly after moving in to repair or replace these items. These things may be covered if you live in a condo, but it’s still important to consider this question during your search. 

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>
