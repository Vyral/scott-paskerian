You’ve likely heard of Zillow’s Zestimate feature, but can you really trust this online tool?&nbsp;

When Zillow assigns a numerical value to a home through their Zestimate feature, the figure is determined by a computer algorithm. This algorithm is based on things like a home’s square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms it has. It also takes into account comparable properties within a certain mile radius.

**It’s the items Zillow’s Zestimate doesn’t account for that tend to cause problems.** The issue with the Zestimate is that it doesn’t consider specific neighborhoods, upgrades, or other significant home features when it assigns a value to your property. A bathroom remodel or a recently added room will go unaccounted for.

So while Zestimates can be a decent starting point, even Zillow admits that the tool has a wide margin of error. Here in South Florida, an estimated 50% of Zestimates are within 8.9% of a home’s true value. **The CEO of Zillow himself had a Zestimate on his home that was 40% higher than what his property actually sold for.&nbsp;**

Another factor Zestimates fail to consider is which school district a property falls within. As we all know, school districts can have a significant impact on home value.&nbsp;

Ultimately, the bottom line is this: **If you want to know your home’s true value, you must consult with an experienced, local real estate agent.** You need to have a conversation with someone who knows the area, the school districts, and who can see the true condition of your home.&nbsp;

So if you have any other questions, would like more information, or want to discuss the true value of your home, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
