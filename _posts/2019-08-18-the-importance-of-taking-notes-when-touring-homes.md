When you visit different listings during your home search, it’s easy to become overwhelmed and forget important details. If you want to make sure you keep the listings you’ve toured straight in your mind, there’s one simple step you must follow: take notes.&nbsp;

**Using a notepad, or even just your phone, to record your thoughts during each visit will allow you to remember the things you liked (and didn’t like) more easily later on.** Having photos and notes to look back on when you think about which properties stood out as top contenders will also help you to ultimately to select your future home.&nbsp;
